### The Rani Readme

- No specific action required for running code
- A couple know problems are:
	- Use of namespace std
	- Some comments are broken into two lines for the sake of < 80 chars
	- Problems with compiling using -Wall and -std=c++11
	- Had to use unsigned ints in error check loops because of compiler warnings
