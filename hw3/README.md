##### Permutations (Problem 4)
- To compile run `g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 permutations.cpp -o permutations`
- Needs main to input a string to the permutations function.

##### Cave Exploration (Problem 5)
- To compile just `make cave`.
- Tested up to 4 million inputs, runtime seems to be Θ(n).

##### Startup Companies (Problem 6)
- To compile you would need a makefile and write a `main`,  since I'm not submitting them.
- Need to link company.cpp and company.hpp (I left the .hpp extension as it was provided).
- Getting the runtime correct was tricky, but I'm pretty sure it's Θ(n) now.
